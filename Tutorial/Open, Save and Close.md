### Create a Photoshop File:
This is a very hard and delicate task, so do it carefully at your **Own Risk**.

To do this dangerous task you need to click on the **New** button in the home screen.

A very annoying page will popup. Don't worry, I'm here to guide you through the annoying stuff.

All you need to know is that you need to set a width and a height for your new canvas to draw on, That's it.

Personally I like to start with a 1200 x 800 canvas, But it's up to you.

**Oh and make sure it's calculating units by pixels so we don't get into trouble with Mother Photoshop later on.**
