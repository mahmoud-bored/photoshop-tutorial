# The very very Basics
If you havn't used any editing program before, I suggest that you go through this 4 min Tutorial before getting started with the good stuff.

> **You do NOT need to read any text in this file, you can just follow along with the GIFs 😓**.  
Most of the text is just sarcastic anyways.
### It is very Simple
Just: 
* Create
* Save  
* Close
* Open again

a Photoshop File. 
#### Easy, Right? Let's get started then.
### Create a Photoshop File:
This is a very hard and delicate task, so do it carefully at your **Own Risk**.

To do this dangerous task you need to click on the **New** button in the home screen.

A very annoying page will popup. Don't worry, I'm here to guide you through the annoying stuff.

All you need to know is that you need to set a width and a height for your new canvas to draw on, That's it.

Personally I like to start with a 1200 x 800 canvas, But it's up to you.

**Oh and make sure it's calculating units by pixels so we don't get into trouble with Mother Photoshop later on.**

### Save a Photoshop File:
If you did the First one I'm sure you can do this one too. If you can't, then get out of here. No one likes lazy people(except me, they love me... right? 🥺).

> To save your work into a new photoshop file you can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>  
Or if you have already saved it into a Photoshop file, you can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> to save it into that existing file.

And if you're 74.6 years old or one these people who LOOOOVE to make life difficult, You can go to File > Save/Save As, then pick where you want to save it and click "**Save**".

If you use this method and we meet by any chance in the future don't talk/wave/approach me and always be keen to keep a 5 meter distance between me and you, Thanks.

### Close a Photoshop File
> Press the X Button next to the file name.

### Open a Photoshop File

Basically you have 3 ways to do this:
* Drag'n Drop (For teenagers)
* Keyboard Shortcut (For Normal/Abnormal People)
* THE MENU BAR (....)

#### Drag'n Drop

#### Keyboard Shortcut
> Simply just press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>O</kbd>, locate your File and click "**Open**"
